          Designcrafter is a solo operation dedicated to helping you tackle the
          most pressing challenges in early product development.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.pV}>
          Funded or not the early days of product development might be fun but
          brutal. There are soo many challenges:
        </p>

        <ul className={styles.list}>
          <li>It's difficult to know if an idea has really been validated</li>
          <li>Find product-market fit before you run out of money</li>
          <li>It takes too long to conduct robust user research</li>
          <li>Coordinating efforts across the teams</li>
        </ul>

        <p className={styles.pV}>
          To make progress, it's important to have people who have a lot of
          experience around you. These people should be able to think for
          themselves and take action without needing constant direction.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.pV}>
          That's why I started Designcrafter, to help you craft better business
          software, faster. Using product design strategically.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.pV}>
          I'm now 16+ years in the industry in the past 8, Iâ€™ve been designing
          early-stage business software that users love and businesses value. I
          like to help you do the same.
